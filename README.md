# Telemetry

> :warning: Once installed, the .NET SDK will collect telemetry by default ([learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry#how-to-opt-out)). If you don't want to send analytics data to Microsoft, follow the instructions below before (or after) installing the SDK.

To disable telemetry, add the following line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, etc.):

```shell
export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
```

Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect.

```shell
exec $SHELL
```

# Install

Installing this plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add dotnet
# or
asdf plugin add dotnet https://github.com/hensou/asdf-dotnet.git
```

Installing a dotnet version:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all dotnet

# Install specific version
asdf install dotnet latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global dotnet latest

# Now dotnet commands are available
dotnet --version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
